poseyfan27|I turned it off and watched the original cartoon instead.|At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it. [...] Overall, I didn't care too much for it.|6/10|February 2024
ramosaral22|Gorgeous effects, failure of characters|First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. [...] Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.|3/10|February 2024
MissSimonetta|No, it's not that good and don't even compare it to the Netflix One Piece|I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. [...] I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.|6/10|February 2024
pollereulogy|Lost Arc of Aang|I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. [...] Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.|6/10|February 2024

seige-hound|Weak dialogue and rushed pacing compromise an otherwise well-done adaptation|Warning: Spoilers 173 out of 235 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink|6/10|February 2024
bestdesigns|Amazing CGI and Effects, Bad acting and Script|I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times. [...] So its 6/10 for me.|6/10|February 2024
LovecraftKaiju|I usually type long reviews, but I feel empty after watching this...|I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland. [...] Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.|5/10|February 2024
msmy98|Too rushed and soulless|Warning: Spoilers 164 out of 238 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink|5/10|February 2024
katedodson148|Show it, don't tell it|The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. [...] Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.|5/10|February 2024
antonbeukes-7270|Excellent VFx but story and writing is lacking.|Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. [...] The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced.|6/10|February 2024
catarinakulborg|I mean... I kind of love it?|The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :) It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.|8/10|February 2024
halukkocadere|Where is the humour?|As a longtime fan of "Avatar: The Last Airbender," I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.|6/10|February 2024
musings-morsels|Brings a tear to my eye|It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show.|8/10|February 2024
suchalad|Surprisingly, this is actually quite good|If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to the story but those changes were brilliant.|9/10|February 2024
roberto_di_bisceglia|It is hard to watch when you care|The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? [...] Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.|5/10|February 2024
ahmed-emre|Literally have no emotions|I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series.|3/10|February 2024
Raewulf|Replace all the writers with Aaron Ehasz|I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. [...] By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh.|3/10|February 2024
poseidon-thoughts|You won't get a better live adaptation then this.|Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be.|8/10|February 2024
jacobtarter|If u give it a shot, with an open mind it's pretty good. But if you come in expecting the original ur not gunna like it much|Since I can't give halves, I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9. Acting was pretty good, some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara.|9/10|February 2024
just_funme|10/10 for the trailer team, every else only gets the participation trophy|Warning: Spoilers 179 out of 322 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote. Permalink|3/10|February 2024
Osurmak|Watered down and simplified|This adaptation has no resemblance with the original in any shape or form if you look at it from the story. It is so simplified and lacks any depth that it doesnt convey the multifaceted messages the original conveyed perfectly.|2/10|March 2024
jeffreykare|Not perfect, but it's still really good!|As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish.|8/10|February 2024
oklaloghead|If You Don't Like It... Rewatch the Orginal|There's no perfect way to recreate a beloved animated series come to life in a live action format. But this comes close and is so good.|8/10|March 2024

Osurmak|Watered down and simplified|This adaptation has no resemblance with the original in any shape or form if you look at it from the story. It is so simplified and lacks any depth that it doesn't convey the multifaceted messages the original conveyed perfectly. It begs the question as to why would any sane person do this?|2/10|March 2024
jeffreykare|Not perfect, but it's still really good!|As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike.|8/10|February 2024
oklaloghead|If You Don't Like It... Rewatch the Original|There's no perfect way to recreate a beloved animated series come to life in a live action format. But this comes close and is so good. Not only is it faithful to what the original series was and tried to convey, but it adds even more lore and detail to the whole storyline.|8/10|March 2024
jacobtarter|If you give it a shot, with an open mind it's pretty good. But if you come in expecting the original you're not gonna like it much|Since I can't give halves, I was gonna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9. Acting was pretty good, some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since they're newer actors.|9/10|February 2024
poseidon-thoughts|You won't get a better live adaptation than this|Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan, you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes.|8/10|February 2024
Raewulf|Replace all the writers with Aaron Ehasz|I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean.|3/10|February 2024
ahmed-emre|Literally have no emotions|I don't even know why people compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe.|3/10|February 2024
roberto_di_bisceglia|It is hard to watch when you care|The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or storytelling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there.|5/10|February 2024

antonbeukes-7270|Excellent VFx but story and writing is lacking|Overall I enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute to the original story and characters but that is where my problems with the show begin.|6/10|February 2024
katedodson148|Show it, don't tell it|The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately, the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning, middle, and end in the first 20 minutes.|5/10|February 2024

bestdesigns|Amazing CGI and Effects, Bad acting and Script|I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times. Good things: Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldn't be better.|6/10|February 2024
